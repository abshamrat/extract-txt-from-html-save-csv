## Extract Text From HTML Elements and Save As CSV File
This is a nodejs based project. Here we are using `node-html-parser` module for parsing HTML file and traversing interested tags and extracting text from them. After collecting data we are saving it to CSV using `csv-writer` node module

## Quick Start
- Require nodejs >= 8
- Install required modules `npm install`
- Start parser `npm start`
- Output csv will be saved in `outputs` folder
